Nuggets (NUG)

ALL YOUR NUGGETS ARE BELONG TO US

This project does not belong anymore to fuckers and computer illiterates. **Post your suggestions** in the Nuggets thread. I will not answer but I will take them into account.

I do not have Windows so that would be great if a person builds a binary each time a new version comes.

As Vlad2Vlad doesn't seem very collaborative I'll totally change the algorithm unless:
* Vlad2Vlad pays me 25BTC here: 1GeP4aCmHeFcEiohuXsQSeafdwTiyNoLDt before end of July 2013.
* Or majority of people in the thread ask me to return him the ownership.

Otherwise he will lose any involvment he had with this currency and I will make his premine unspendable or make a new blockchain that will supersede the current flawed one.
